    for x86. Exception is made for JIT compilers used for hardware offload,
    sitting in their drivers, such as
    [linux/drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/bpf/jit.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/bpf/jit.c)
    for Netronome NFP.
-   [linux/net/sched/](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/sched),
    and in particular in files `act_bpf.c` (action) and `cls_bpf.c` (filter):
    code related to BPF actions and filters with TC.
-   [linux/kernel/seccomp.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/seccomp.c):
    code related to seccomp.
-   [linux/net/core/dev.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/core/dev.c)
    contains the function `dev_change_xdp_fd()` that is called through a
    Netlink command to hook a XDP program to a device, after is has been loaded
    into the kernel from user space. This function in turns uses a callback
    from the relevant driver.

## Tools and utilities

### bcc

-   [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/) framework and set of tools - One way
    to handle BPF programs, in particular for tracing and monitoring. Also
    includes some utilities that may help inspect maps or programs on the
    system.
-   [P4 compiler for BPF targets](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/src/cc/frontends/p4/compiler)
    for bcc - An alternative to the restricted C.
-   [Lua front-end](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/src/lua) for
    bcc - Another alternative to C, and even to most of the Python code used in
    bcc.

### iproute2

-   [iproute2](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/iproute2/iproute2.git) -
    Package containing tools for network management on Linux. In particular, it
    contains `tc`, used to manage eBPF filters and actions, and `ip`, used to
    manage XDP programs. Most of the code related to BPF is in lib/bpf.c.
-   [iproute2-next](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/iproute2/iproute2-next.git) -
    The development tree, synchronised with net-next.

### LLVM

-   [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) package contains several tools used in eBPF
    workflow. Snapshots of the latest versions for Ubuntu/Debian can be
    retrieved from [here](http://apt.llvm.org/).
    -   clang is used to compile C to eBPF object file under the ELF format
        (clang v3.7.1+). The BPF backend was added with
        [this commit](https://reviews.llvm.org/D6494).
    -   llvm-objdump is used to dump the content of an object file in
        human-readable format, possibly with the initial C source code
        (llvm-objdump v4.0+).
    -   llvm-mc is used to compile from LLVM intermediate representation to
        eBPF object file, so that one can compile from C to eBPF assembly,
        tinker with assembly, then compile to ELF file.

### bpftool and others from the kernel tree

-   [bpftool](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/tree/tools/bpf/bpftool)
    and other tools in the kernel tree, under
    [linux/tools/net/](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/net?h=v4.14)
    for versions earlier than 4.15, or
    [linux/tools/bpf/](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/tree/tools/bpf)
    after that:
    -   `bpftool` - A generic utility that can be used to interact with eBPF
        programs and maps from userspace, for example to show, dump, load,
        disassemble, pin programs, or to show, create, pin, update, delete
        maps, or to attach and detach programs to cgroups.
    -   `bpf_asm` - A minimal cBPF assembler.
    -   `bpf_dbg` - A small debugger for cBPF programs.
    -   `bpf_jit_disasm` - A disassembler for both BPF flavors and could be
        highly useful for JIT debugging.

### User space eBPF

-   [uBPF](https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf/) - Written in C. Contains an
    interpreter, a JIT compiler for x86_64 architecture, an assembler and a
    disassembler.
-   [A generic implementation](https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/generic-ebpf) -
    With support for FreeBSD kernel, FreeBSD user space, Linux kernel, Linux
    user space and MacOSX user space. Used for the [BPF extension module for
    VALE switch](https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/vale-bpf).
-   [rbpf](https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf) - Written in Rust. Interpreter for
    Linux, MacOSX and Windows, and JIT-compiler for x86_64 under Linux.

### Testing in virtual environments

-   [A Vagrant setup](https://github.com/iovisor/xdp-vagrant) - To easily test
    XDP. Less useful now that generic XDP (driver-independant, mostly for
    testing) exists.
-   [bcc in a Docker container](https://github.com/zlim/bcc-docker).

## Development and Community

-   [The bpf-next tree](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/) -
    BPF patches land in this tree. It is regularly merged into
    [net-next](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git),
    which is itself merged for each release to Linus' tree.
-   [Kernel documentation](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/tree/Documentation/bpf/bpf_devel_QA.txt)
    about contributions to BPF.
-   [The netdev mailing list](http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/) - Mailing list
    for Linux kernel networking stack development. All patches are sent there
    for review and inclusion.
-   [XDP-newbies](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#xdp-newbies) - A
    mailing list specially dedicated to XDP programming (both for architecture
    or for asking for help).
-   [IO Visor mailing list](http://lists.iovisor.org/pipermail/iovisor-dev/) -
    BPF is at the heart of the project, and is regularly discussed on the
    mailing list.
-   [@IOVisor Twitter account](https://twitter.com/IOVisor).
